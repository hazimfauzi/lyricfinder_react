This is my first React app by following tutorial by Traversy Media. 

About this app:
In this project mini-series we will create an app that we can use to search song lyrics using Reacts built in context API along with the Musixmatch public API.

Note:
If you want to know how i build this app... You need to watch this playlist from Brad Traversy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDEt0KdDbhk&list=PLillGF-RfqbaxgxkKgKk1XlJAVCX31xRI

Thank Brad Traversy.
